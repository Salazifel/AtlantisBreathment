# AtlantisBreathment
This repositroy contains a gamification approach that engages patients with lung diseases (e.g. Asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD) to participate in an app-based breath training by using a theme and narratives as a core game mechanic.

Please start the game with scene "IntroVideo".
For testing purposes this game only contains one exercise.
